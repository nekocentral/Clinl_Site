        <h4>FAQ</h4>
        <p><b>Why are you using C++?</b><br>
        The advantage of C++ is follows: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can abstract the code easily with -namespaces -classes -generics</li>
            <li>C++ has many compile-time features</li>
            <li>C++ can do as much as C and even more</li>
            <li>It has an extensive Standard library which guarantees optimal implementations of functions</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Why can't you just help developing Linux?</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>We are not dependent on the already existing source code which is anything but readable</li>
            <li>Since We are in an environment that's easily maintainable, bugs will be more easy to patch</li>
            <li>Since we are not dependent of Linus Torvalds, we can opt to add our own syscalls (the syscall to get the amount of free memory is a feature that is cried for by many devs since ages)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Why are you using fossil and not git?</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Because fossil is a self bundled, 1 file contains everything.</li>
            <li>It's close enough to git that people that came from that platform aren't lost.</li>
            <li>It favors smaller team which we prefer as it creates a good group cohesion.</li>
            <li>It works fully offline, meaning if you go offline you can see the wiki or the issue's that are assigned to you.</li>
        </ol>
