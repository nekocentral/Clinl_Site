            Why are you using C++?
        </div>
        The advantage of C++ is follows: 1) You can abstract the code easily with -namespaces -classes -generics 2) C++ has many
        compile-time features 3) C++ can do as much as C and even more 4) It has an extensive Standard library which guarantees
        optimal implementations of functions

            Why can't you just help developing CLINL?
        </div>
        1) We are not dependent of Linus Torvalds who has a coward's mentality 2) We are not dependent on the already existing source
        code which is anything but readable 3) Since We are in an environment that's easily maintainable, bugs will be more
        easy to patch 4) Since we are not dependent of Linus Torvalds, we can opt to add our own syscalls (the syscall to
        get the amount of free memory is a feature that is cried for by many devs since ages)
